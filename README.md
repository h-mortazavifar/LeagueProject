# Footbal League Project
I made it for my Java class at university.
In here you can make up to 6 football leagues with as many teams and players as you want. It is mad with JFoenix and material design. There is a tiny music player at the bottom of the window. You can browse for your music file and play it, move the seek and lower or upper the sound. The address of the file will be shown and  also the full and remaining time of playing. You make matches between the teams that you made and have a report of these data:
 
    5 players with most goals
    teams that didn't take any goals
    3 matches with most goals
    matches with no goal.
### Feature:
• Cool rounded corners

• Music player included

• Beautiful material design

• Beautiful background slideshow

#### It is still a work in progress and has some drawbacks:
• Report generation not working yet

• Match making is not working yet although UI is provided
