# Footbal League Project
I made it for my Java class at university.
In here you can make up to 6 footbal leagues with as many teams and players as you want. It is mad with JFoenix and meterial design. There is a tiny music player at the bottom of the window. You can browse for your music file and play it, move the seek and lower or upper the sound. The address of the file will be shown and  also the full and remaining time of playing. You make matches between the teams that you made and have a report of these data: 5 players with most goals, teams that didn't take any goals, 3 matches with most goals, matches with no goal.
### Feature:
• Cool rounded corners

• Music player included
